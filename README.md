# Image Color Picker Tool
This tool was developed using PyGame and is a standalone version of the Photoshop eyedropper tool, and many other color selector tools.

I developed the tool because I wanted a quicker way to grab RGB values from images with colors I liked. This way I can run a quick Python script rather than opening Photoshop or using a tool on the web.
